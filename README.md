# MCMC_tutorial
Tutorial to do MCMC sampling in Python.

The focus of this tutorial is to understand how the error in the training data is
propagated to the parameters when we do regression. We will start the tutorial by
utilizing a Monte Carlo method to see how the uncertainty of the training data propagates
to the parameters. Then, we will look at a local approximation of parameter uncertainty
via the Fisher information matrix (FIM). Finally, we will touch on how to do MCMC
simulation using Python `emcee` package.
